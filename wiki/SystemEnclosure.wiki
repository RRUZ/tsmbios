#summary System Enclosure or Chassis (Type 3)

= Description =
The information in this structure defines attributes of the systemâ€™s mechanical enclosure(s). For example, if a system included a separate enclosure for its peripheral devices, two  structures would be returned: one for the main system enclosure and the second for the peripheral device
enclosure. The additions to this structure in version 2.1 of the SMBIOS specification support the population of the CIM_Chassis class.
